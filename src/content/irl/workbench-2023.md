After getting the frames done in time for Mother's Day, I made my workbench. Before I had been using an old glass display case we inherited with the house which was not ideal. 

After much hemming and hawing, I decided to use a leftover interior door as the benchtop. This used to be the door from our laundry room to the kitchen, but after removing it to paint it we decided to leave it off. These are very _robust_ doors and annoyingly heavy, and...free. So I built a frame out of 2x4's (with some fancy half-lap joints) and attached it. It's worked very well as a workbench. 

#### Pros:

  - Not a glass display case
    - This is indented
  - Deep enough to have tools/junk in the back section while working on something in the front section
  - Enough width to have multiple things going on at once
  - Made to my height (I'm 6'3"), so less slouching :)

<br />

#### Cons:

  - I'm not confident the top is perfectly flat, but it's flat enough for what I do and I don't have the proper tools to make it flat anyways. Maybe one day I'll invest in a hand plan and flatten it.
  - Too tall for my wife to comfortably use
  - I should have made it match the height of my table saw. It's about an inch and a half too tall to be an outfeed table. I've resorted to putting little spacer blocks under my table saw when I make super long cuts (for the king sized bed) which is _crazy sketch_. One day I gotta build a cabinet for my table saw.
