My wife wanted to upgrade our outdoor space in time to enjoy the nice fall weather, so I opened the workshop back up and built an outdoor love seat for her. 

I followed [this video](https://youtu.be/crdwJW5tL1s?si=9MkjiAvRbUlFu9gb) and purchased the plans from the content creator since I was too lazy to figure it out myself. I purchased rough cedar from Home Depot and got to work cutting it down with my new Bosch glide miter saw :). We found the cushions at [Walmart](https://www.walmart.com/ip/Arden-Selections-Outdoor-Deep-Seat-Cushion-Set-24-x-24-Water-Repellant-Fade-Resistant-Bottom-Back-Chair-Sofa-Couch-Peacock-Blue-Green-Texture/1880045838).

The project came together pretty well, and was a great opening project for the upcoming woodworking season. It goes very nicely with the [end table I built last year](http://localhost:4321/irl/outdoor-end-tables) (especially after I refinished it and threw another coat of oil on it). I'm excited to be back in the garage.
