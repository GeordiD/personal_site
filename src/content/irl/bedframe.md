At the beginning of the year, we upgraded from a queen sized bed to a king and thus needed new bedroom furniture. After doing much research, we landed on this design from [Thuma](https://www.thuma.co/products/classic-bed?variant=40242991071337). I followed along with [this YouTube video](https://youtu.be/EQ-ZoQU0fOk?si=cgkgkCORJUbZkDy1), but all the dimensions and final plans came from me.

This was by far the largest project I've ever built and I learned so many new things while making this. The biggest lesson was that the size of the project greatly impacts the amount of time something takes. It's easy to breeze through building an end table, but this beast just took time. I also learned about lumberyards! I found a local lumberyard for this hard maple and was blown away by how much cheaper it was vs what I had been pricing out via online lumber stores. Total lumber cost came out to be under $400, which was much cheaper that anything we could buy for similar quality.

In the end, I'm very happy with the outcome. The bed looks stunning, and I kind of can't believe that I made it. I'm very proud, although I do have a lot more respect for taking on large projects: three and a half months is a loooooong time to be working on a single project.
