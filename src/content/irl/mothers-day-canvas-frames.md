This was the first project I built after getting my shop set up with a table saw: four canvas frames to gift to my mom, mother-in-law, sister-in-law(in-law), and a new mom in our community group. My wife started the project with deciding to paint bouquets of flowers from the moms' kids' birth months. I decided all these canvases needed frames too, and it was the inciting incident to actually start making things at home and filling out my tool collection.

The frames are made of hard maple with walnut splines. They are finished with dutch oil. Original artwork by [Kristin Dosher](https://www.kristindosher.com/).
