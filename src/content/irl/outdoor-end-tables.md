Our house has a deck in the backyard that we like to sit out at, so I built a outdoor side/end table to hold our drinks and things. I was trying to make this project on a budget, so I used four cedar fence pickets as the materials for it. Run it through the planer and sand it down and you couldn't even tell. It came out so nice I decided to build a copy for my father for Christmas.
